1. Using Lapack++
=================

1.1. Needed Components
----------------------

You need DLLs of BLAS and Lapack.
The contrib folder contains a patch against the latest lapack.tgz package
which allows creating DLLs from the original source package.

Alternatively, use the self-installing setup.exe file of lapackpp;
this will include a DLL for blas and for lapack.


2. Compiling Lapack++
=====================

This section is only for compiling lapackpp yourself; if you
installed the self-installing setup.exe file, you don't need to
consider this section.

This section is for compiling with the gcc compiler. If you want
to use the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler instead, use the provided
project file lapackpp.vcproj. For installation copy the resulting
Debug/lapackpp.lib into whatever location you consider
appropriate.


2.1. Needed Components
----------------------

2.1.1. MinGW32

MinGW32 is a project with the goal to provide a free compiler system and a
nearly complete shell environment which allows to execute the configure 
script. The resulting DLLs and EXEs only link against Windows libraries, so
there are no licence issues when releasing binary packages.
The compiler itself is the very well known GCC.

MinGW creates an environment just like under Linux (with quite the same
file hierarchie, including a home directory).
Paths including hard drive identifiers are used like this:
c:\SOMEPATH -> /c/SOMEPATH
d:\SOMEPATH -> /d/SOMEPATH
and so on.

The root directory of MinGW is a a subdirectory of the one you installed
mingw to, in most cases "c:\msys\1.0". So "/" from inside the shell actually 
refers to that directory.

You can get MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/

Install instructions:
- download and install MSYS 1.0.9 
  (there is an executable, which wants to install itself to "c:/msys". 
  This is a good choice, so from here on I assume you have choosen this path,
  too)
- download and install  MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe (when asked for the install path
  please make sure you use "c:/msys/1.0/mingw" !!)
- download and install msysDTK-1.0.1.exe (it finds its install path by itself)

There are many more packages on their download site, but you don't need them, 
since most of them are already included in the packages we just installed.


2.1.2. BLAS, Lapack
-------------------
You only need the DLLs of BLAS and Lapack.
The contrib folder contains a patch against the latest lapack.tgz package
which allows creating DLLs from the original source package.

Download lapack.tgz from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/.



2.2. Compiling
==============

Just type 

  ./configure YOUR_OPTIONS
  make 

This will create the DLL needed by other projects. It will be copied
to your Windows system folder when you type "make install".

Some common options for ./configure concern the library name of blas
and lapack, and also additional library search paths in LDFLAGS if
your MinGW installation is in a non-standard path. E.g.:

  ./configure --disable-atlas --with-blas=blas32 --with-lapack=lapack32 \
    LDFLAGS="-L/mingw/lib -L/c/WINNT/system32" 


2.3 Installation
================

Type 

  make install

to have the header files copied to the chosen prefix (default
/usr/local) and to have the DLL liblapackpp32.dll copied into your
Windows system folder.
