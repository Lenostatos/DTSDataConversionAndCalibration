lapack.diff
===========

This file contains a diff against the original lapack.tgz package.
You need to apply this patch in order to create DLLs for WIN32 platforms.

You will need MinGW32 to compile Lapack (see README.W32 in top source dir).

After unpacking the package and applying the patch you can create DLLs by
typing
 make -fMakefile.win32

This will most probably take some time.

The resulting DLLs should be copied to a location where Windows can find
them (this usually is the windows folder).

The resulting libblas32.dll is not optimized for your system !
So it would be best tou get an optimized BLAS library.
However, this library works, so you may try it first.


Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC)
==================================

If you want to build lapackpp with MSVC but still use the
libblas32.dll and liblapack32.dll, you need to do the following to
create the required import libraries libblas32.lib and
liblapack32.lib: 

First get the LAPACK package, unpack it and apply this diff. Then
compile the LAPACK package by mingw32 as explained above. 

After this has finished, go into the LAPACK directory BLAS/SRC and
call the lib.exe program of your MSVC installation (located in
Vc7/bin/lib.exe) as follows:

  lib.exe /def:libblas32.def

This will create the import library libblas32.lib; copy it
wherever you want to keep it. Then do the same in the LAPACK
directory SRC:

  lib.exe /def:liblapack32.def

which will create the import library liblapack32.lib. With these,
you can now compile lapackpp with MSVC and create a lapackpp.dll
file that works with MSVC and depends on the libblas32.dll and
liblapack32.dll.
